## Upload notice

This project was originally created by [bovarysme](https://github.com/bovarysme), but for some unknown reason, the repository was removed. Because the project was released under the MIT license, I have re-uploaded it due to its usage in another project of mine, [go-ppm](https://github.com/JoshuaDoes/go-ppm).
